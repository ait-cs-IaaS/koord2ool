## [Unreleased]
### Changed
- Line charts will no longer render with steps (#4).

## [0.2.0] - 2022-07-27
### Added

- Application errors are now relayed to the user as an alert.
- Data is now loaded on-demand as opposed to eagerly upon successful authentication.

### Removed

- The legacy way to use `TIME` in surveys to mark the time of submission is now removed.
  Instead, the `submitdate` property exposed by LimeSurvey will be used.
  Unless the survey was marked as anonymized, this field holds the exact time of the submission.

### Changed

- The UI no longer shows the number of responses for a given survey.
  This is due to the lazy loading added to the application in this version.
- Line charts will now render with steps.
- The favicon was updated to replace the default Vue icon.
